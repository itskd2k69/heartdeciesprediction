# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient using machine learning algorithms based on various medical attributes.

## 📌 Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. Early diagnosis can help reduce risks and ensure timely treatment. This project leverages machine learning techniques to build a predictive model for heart disease based on patient data.
